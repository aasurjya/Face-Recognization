# Face-Recognization
FaceNet is a deep learning model for face recognition that was developed by Google. It works by creating a high-dimensional embedding (a vector of numbers) for each face in an image, and then comparing those embeddings to determine if two faces belong to the same person or not. FaceNet can be used for both face recognition (determining who a face belongs to) and face verification (determining if two faces belong to the same person).

Face clustering is the process of grouping together similar faces in a dataset. This can be useful in applications where you have a large number of images of people and you want to group them by person. Face clustering is typically done by first extracting facial features from each image using a face recognition model (such as FaceNet), and then using clustering algorithms (such as K-means clustering) to group together images with similar features. The resulting clusters can then be used to label images by person, or to search for images of a particular person in a large dataset.
